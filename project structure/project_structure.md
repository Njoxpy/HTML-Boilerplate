# Project Structure

- Inside the project structure bash file there is a file which enables a developer to create a boiler plate for the project by just running `project_structure.sh`.

```sh
# run this command
sh project_structure.sh
```

## Creating Folder

- We do create a same folder daily into our projects, to to save time when ceating a project for pure javascript applications what is required is just creating a basic project templates, to be able to use this template, for windows user make sure you have Git bash installed into your system also for Linux user you can just run using the following command.

```sh
# run this command
./project_structure.sh
```

- Make sure to navigate into the project which you want your project folder to be created, it can be on desktop for windows user then create a file named `project structure.sh`, open terminal at desktop and run the using the following command `sh project structure.sh`

```sh
sh project structure.sh
```
